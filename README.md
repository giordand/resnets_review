# Resnets_review

This repo is a review of Residual Networks implemented with TFLearn. We provide 3 differents scripts in which you can reproduce experiments with PlainNets, 3 differents structures of residual blocks (full pre-activation, ReLU pre activation and original He et. al. 2015) and a new design where we interchange the sum with a substraction.
